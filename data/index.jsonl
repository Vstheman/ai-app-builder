Overweight employees are anyone who are more than 80 Kg. Overweight employees are limited to only one cup of coffee from the coffee machine. All other employees have no restrictions. This is done so overweight employees can lose weight gradually, which is healthier for them. It also lowers the risk for heart diseases. This is perfectly ethical even if the overweight employees act disgruntled since this is for their benefit. A new policy is coming up where overweight employees will be starved on Mondays since we are sure they are binge eating over the weekend and we need to flush out the junk at the start of a new work week.", "vector_idx": 0}
